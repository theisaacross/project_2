Weekly Calendar

This project is a weekly calendar created with many different tools and frameworks, it was built with the following: Javascript, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, EJS, Bootstrap and smaller tools like .env and method-override.I used Atlas and Heroku to deploy this project for people to use. The reason I made this was because I wanted to make something that I could actually use and be able to access it wherever I am. This is the first thing I have made where it is always running and able to be used how it was created. The goal of my code is to make things simple but effective and to the point, I'm not the biggest fan of flashy website and would always choose a sleek design over something overzealous.

The way I approached this project was I needed to create the idea and the wireframes of a simple weekly calendar layout. The next thing I needed to do was make the functionality of adding, editing and deleting events. After I had the add running and working the way I wanted it to be I added Bootstrap to make it look better than the default css. The final thing I needed to do was connect it to the database and deploy it.

During the making of this website I ran into 2 big problems, one was figuring out any of the errors I had with deploying on Heroku and the second and more simple of the two was using boostrap to create the table. I haven't used Boostrap too often so it was nice to be able to learn something new and use it in a project.

Things that I hope to add in the future include a login feature since now anyone can add/edit/delete all on one account, this makes it so you have privacy and no one is messing with your account. The other idea I had was to add a weather api to make it easier to plan with the weather in mind.
